* Loop near Fen Ditton and trail immediately north of Balsham can get muddy, but
  fine in summer.
* Eastern section along Roman Road can get overgrown.
* If you have half an hour to spare, head south from the southernmost top of the
  route to follow the bridleway to the top of Rivey Hill, and enjoy the view
  over Linton.
